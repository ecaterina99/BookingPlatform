#Project Vision

This project is a backend-focused Service Booking Platform that allows organizations such as clinics, hospitals, and salons to manage specialists, services, working schedules, and client bookings.

The system is designed as a platform, not a directory. Organizations register themselves and fully manage their own data, including specialists, services, and availability. Clients can browse available services in a selected city and book available time slots.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate strong backend architecture, business logic, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles rather than UI complexity.
